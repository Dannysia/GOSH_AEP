            <h1 id="title">What is V.I.S.I.O.N.?</h1>
            <p>
                V.I.S.I.O.N. is an initiative to provide accurate and timely reporting of infrastructure degradation.
                As an acronym, VISION stands for Verification of Infrastructure Stability and Insight into Operational Networks.
                This system utilizes photos and GPS data from aerial surveying drones to evaluate damages to power distribution infrastructure.
                Data can then be reviewed and labeled for further review and maintenance by human operators.
                <br><br>
                The insights provided by V.I.S.I.O.N. are intended to increase the efficiency of maintenance activities by
                reducing the lead time between surveying of infrastructure and the application of corrective maintenance.
                V.I.S.I.O.N. can also provide early warning of potential reliability issues and degradation,
                for which quick preventative maintenance can increase short-term reliability.
